**Bring live radio to your Geometry Dash experience!**

Ventilla replaces the default main menu music with a continuous, high-quality live radio stream (`radio.5infin.es`). 

Be careful! Right now the radio its making its way to become adapted for english listeners, so, dont worry if you hear any spanish voice sometimes.

## Basic Features

### Live Menu Music
Say goodbye to the repetitive "MenuLoop.mp3". Enjoy a 24/7 live radio broadcast that plays across all menu screens (Main Menu, Level Select, Creator Tab, and more) in real time.

### Simple Volume Control
* **In Menus:** The radio plays at your preferred volume.
* **In Levels:** The radio automatically mutes (0% volume) when you enter a level, ensuring you can focus on the gameplay and the level's music.
* **Auto-Resume:** As soon as you exit the level, the radio fades back in instantly.

### Outside of Geometry Dash
* After you leave the game as for example to the desktop area without closing the game, the radio still sounds! This option appears in the configuration menu disabled by default.

### Native Basic UI & Metadata
* Adds a new **Radio Button** to the bottom of the Main Menu.
* Displays a native **Status Popup** showing:
    * Connection Status (Live / Reconnecting).
    * **Now Playing**: Shows the current Song and Artist.
    * **Enable/Disable**: Toggle the mod on or off on the fly to relax a bit.
    * **Website**: Quick access to the radio's webpage.

### Auto-Reconnection
Includes a "Watchdog" system. If your internet flickers or the server restarts, the mod detects the silence and automatically attempts to reconnect without crashing the game.
